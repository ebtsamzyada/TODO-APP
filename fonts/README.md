# Font Files

This directory should contain the Roboto font files referenced in pubspec.yaml:

- Roboto-Regular.ttf
- Roboto-Bold.ttf

You can download these fonts from:
- Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
- Or use the system default fonts by removing the fonts section from pubspec.yaml

## Usage

The fonts are configured in pubspec.yaml and will be automatically used throughout the app when available.
